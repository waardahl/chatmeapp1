## chat me
## by Henrik Waardahl & Edward Lind√©n

## is a chat app where you can create chat rooms and talk to people in real-time on the server. You can chat with several people at the same time by creating a group chat or just talk to one friend. There's also a community chat where yo can talk to everyone connected. By searching for a user you can find them and start a chat with them too. Using google maps API you are also able to see who's online on a map and press their icon to see their name. 

# NOTE! in order to simulate other people connected you can just duplicate the browser window and go to inspect the page with devtools to get some settings available. Then press the three dots next to where you would close the devtools window. Go to "More tools" and then press "Sensors". There at Geolocation you can press Manage to add a location. Choose some lat and lng for your simulated friend. Don't forget to change to the geolocation you created and then refresh the page. Then you should be able to have another position for just that browser window.
