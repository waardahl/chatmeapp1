## by Henrik Waardahl & Edward Lind√©n

## is a chat app where you can create chat rooms and talk to people in real-time on the server. You can chat with several people at the same time by creating a group chat or just talk to one friend. There's also a community chat where yo can talk to everyone connected. By searching for a user you can find them and start a chat with them too. Using google maps API you are also able to see who's online on a map and press their icon to see their name.
